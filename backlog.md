## üöÄ Feature Backlog

This backlog is organised into **Epics** (high-level goals), **Features** (deliverable capabilities), and **User Stories** (descriptions of functionality from a user's perspective).

### ### Epic 1: Core Reminder Functionality (MVP)

*As a user, I want a reliable, hourly pop-up for Trello so that I am consistently reminded to review my tasks.*

---

#### **Feature 1.1: Scheduled Task Execution**
*The system must be able to run a script automatically at a set interval.*

* **User Story:** As a user, I want a task to run automatically every hour, so I am reminded consistently without needing to start the tool manually.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        1.  A task must be configured in the OS task scheduler.
        2.  The task must be set to trigger every 1 hour.
        3.  The task trigger must run indefinitely.
        4.  The task can run whether the user is on AC power or battery.

---

#### **Feature 1.2: Intelligent Browser Launch**
*The script must open Trello.com in Firefox in a user-friendly way.*

* **User Story:** As a user, I want the scheduled task to open `trello.com` in Firefox, so I can review my board.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        1.  When the task runs, if Firefox is closed, it must be launched.
        2.  If Firefox is already open, the URL `https://trello.com` must be opened in a new tab.
        3.  The task must not open a *new window* if Firefox is already running.

---

#### **Feature 1.3: Window Focus Management**
*The script must bring the Trello window to the user's immediate attention.*

* **User Story:** As a user, I want the Trello window to pop up over my current work, so it immediately grabs my attention.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        1.  After the Trello tab is opened, the main Firefox window containing it must be brought to the foreground.
        2.  The window must "steal focus" from the currently active application.
        3.  If the Firefox window was minimised, it must be restored to its previous state (e.g., normal or maximised).
        4.  The script must correctly identify the window even if the title includes a specific Trello board name (e.g., "My Board | Trello - Mozilla Firefox").

---

#### **Feature 1.4: Silent Operation**
*The script's execution wrapper (the terminal) must be invisible.*

* **User Story:** As a user, I want the reminder to run without a terminal or console window flashing, so the experience is not jarring or unprofessional.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        1.  When the task runs, no PowerShell or Command Prompt terminal window is visible to the user.
        2.  The operation must be "headless" or hidden, with the only visible effect being the Firefox window coming into focus.

---

### ### Epic 2: V2 Enhancements & Usability

*As a user, I want more control over the reminder, so it better fits my workflow and doesn't interrupt me at inconvenient times.*

---

#### **Feature 2.1: Specific Board Navigation**
*Allow the user to be taken to a specific Trello board, not just the homepage.*

* **User Story:** As a user, I want the pop-up to open my *specific* "To-Do" board, not just the Trello homepage, so I am taken directly to the context I need to review.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        1.  The URL in the script (PowerShell or Python) must be easily changeable to a specific board URL.
        2.  The window-finding logic must still work when the window title reflects the specific board's name.

---

#### **Feature 2.2: "Snooze" / Intelligent Interruption**
*Prevent the pop-up if the user is already actively working in Trello.*

* **User Story:** As a user, if I am *already* using Trello when the hourly reminder is due, I do not want the script to run, so my window isn't jarringly re-focused.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        1.  The script must first check what the user's active foreground window is.
        2.  If the active window title already contains "Trello" and "Mozilla Firefox", the script must exit silently.
        3.  If the active window is anything else, the script proceeds with the normal pop-up logic.

---

#### **Feature 2.3: On-Demand Pause/Resume**
*Allow the user to temporarily disable the hourly reminder.*

* **User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to *pause* the reminders, so I am not interrupted during an important meeting or a deep-work session.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        1.  The user can temporarily disable the `Hourly Trello Popup` task in Windows Task Scheduler.
        2.  The user can re-enable the same task to resume the hourly reminders.

## üöÄ Future Releases (Roadmap)

`Repop` is a simple utility, but it has the potential to become a powerful, cross-platform productivity tool. Here are some of the features and ideas planned for future versions.

### ### üñ•Ô∏è v2.0: Cross-Platform Support

The current version is Windows-only (PowerShell + Task Scheduler). The goal for v2.0 is to provide a unified experience on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

* **Python Core:** Re-write the core pop-up logic in Python.
    * **Windows:** Use `pywin32` for window management.
    * **macOS:** Use `py-applescript` to interact with browser applications.
    * **Linux:** Use `xdotool` or similar utilities to manage windows.
* **Native Schedulers:** The installer will detect the OS and set up the correct native scheduler:
    * **Windows:** Task Scheduler (as it does now).
    * **macOS:** `launchd`
    * **Linux:** `cron`

### ### üóìÔ∏è v1.5: Advanced Scheduling & Intelligence

More control over *when* and *why* the pop-up happens.

* **Active Window Check:** Don't pop up if you're already using the target browser (or a specific app like Zoom/Teams).
* **Day & Time Selection:** Configure `Repop` to run only on specific days (e.g., "Weekdays only") or at specific times (e.g., "Run at 09:00, 13:00, and 17:00").
* **Idle Timer:** Only run the pop-up if the user has been idle for a set number of minutes.

### ### ‚ú® v1.x: Usability & Enhancements

General improvements to make the tool easier to use and more powerful.

* **GUI Configurator:** A simple graphical UI (`config-ui.ps1`) to select your browser, set your URL, and pick your frequency, with a "Save & Install" button.
* **Multi-URL Support:** Update the config to accept an *array* of URLs and frequencies, allowing you to manage multiple pop-ups.
* **Browser Auto-Detection:** Automatically find the `.exe` path for common browsers, so the user only has to provide the name (e.g., "chrome").
* **Logging:** Add a simple `repop.log` file for troubleshooting if the pop-up fails to run.
