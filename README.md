A simple, configurable Windows utility to "re-pop" a specific browser tab to the foreground at a set interval.

---

## üéØ What is Repop?

In a world of a dozen browser tabs and endless distractions, it's easy to forget about that one "single source of truth" tab you're supposed to be checking. For some, it's a Trello board. For others, it's a calendar, a dashboard, or a to-do list.

`Repop` is your persistent, automated "nag" to keep that priority tab in view.

It's a lightweight tool that runs silently in the background. At an interval you choose, it finds your specific URL in your chosen browser and brings it to the foreground, "re-popping" it over your other windows for your attention.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Bring any URL to the foreground:** `https://trello.com`, `https://calendar.google.com`, a local Grafana dashboard, anything.
* **Set any pop-up frequency:** Every 15 minutes, every hour, every 4 hours‚Äîit's up to you.
* **Choose your target browser:** Explicitly supports Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Brave, and more.
* **Intelligent opening:** If the tab is already open, it just brings it to the front. If it's closed, it opens it for you.
* **Silent operation:** Uses the native Windows Task Scheduler for a 100% "headless" operation. No terminal windows ever flash on your screen.
* **Lightweight & No Dependencies:** Written in PowerShell. It uses only the native components built into Windows 10 & 11.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

`Repop` is a single PowerShell script that is run by the **Windows Task Scheduler**.

1.  You provide your settings in a simple `config.ps1` file.
2.  You run the `install.ps1` script (one time).
3.  This installer script creates a new task in Windows Task Scheduler, configured to run `repop.ps1` silently at your chosen frequency.
4.  The `repop.ps1` script handles the logic of finding or opening your browser tab and forcing the window to the foreground.

## üöÄ Installation & Configuration

Getting started is a 2-minute process.

1.  **Get the Code:**
    * **Recommended:** Clone the repository:
        ```bash
        git clone [https://github.com/ChrisClements1987/repop.git](https://github.com/ChrisClements1987/repop.git)
        ```
    * **Alternative:** [Download the .ZIP file](https://github.com/ChrisClements1987/repop/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract it.

2.  **Navigate:**
    * Open the `repop` directory you just downloaded.
        ```powershell
        cd repop
        ```

3.  **Configure:**
    * Open the `config.ps1` file in your favourite text editor (like VS Code or Notepad). This is the **only file you need to edit.**
    * Update the variables to match your needs.

4.  **Install:**
    * Right-click the `install.ps1` file and select **"Run with PowerShell"**.
    * This script will read your `config.ps1` and automatically create the Windows Scheduled Task for you.

That's it! The task is now scheduled and will run at its next interval.

### The `config.ps1` File

This is where you define the behaviour of `Repop`.

```powershell
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# Repop Configuration File
# -----------------------------------------------------------------

$Config = @{
    # The full URL you want to pop up.
    URL = "[https://trello.com/b/your-board-id](https://trello.com/b/your-board-id)"

    # The frequency (in minutes) for the pop-up.
    # The task will run on this schedule (e.g., 60 = every hour).
    FrequencyMinutes = 60

    # The .exe name of your target browser.
    # Common values:
    # "firefox"
    # "chrome"
    # "msedge"
    # "brave"
    BrowserExeName = "firefox"

    # The full path to your browser's executable.
    # The script will try to find this automatically, but if it fails,
    # you can set it manually here.
    # Example: "C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe"
    BrowserExePath = ""

    # The string to search for in the window title to "find" the browser.
    # This is what the script uses to bring the window to the front.
    # Common values:
    # "Mozilla Firefox"
    # "Google Chrome"
    # "Microsoft Edge"
    # "Brave"
    WindowTitleSearch = "Mozilla Firefox"
}
````

### Example: My Personal Trello Setup

This is the configuration I use to pop up my main Trello board in Firefox every hour.

```powershell
$Config = @{
    URL = "[https://trello.com/b/qjXFqZ8k/my-main-board](https://trello.com/b/qjXFqZ8k/my-main-board)"
    FrequencyMinutes = 60
    BrowserExeName = "firefox"
    BrowserExePath = "C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe"
    WindowTitleSearch = "Mozilla Firefox"
}
```

## üîß Making Changes

If you want to change the frequency or URL, just:

1.  Edit the `config.ps1` file and save it.
2.  Run the `install.ps1` script again. It will automatically delete the old task and create a new one with your updated settings.

## üóëÔ∏è Uninstalling

To remove `Repop` completely:

1.  Right-click the `uninstall.ps1` file.
2.  Select **"Run with PowerShell"**.
3.  This will find and delete the scheduled task from Windows Task Scheduler.
4.  You can then safely delete the `repop` folder.
